# 2016 US Presidential Election Forecast

## SAFE Model

For fun, I put together a very, very simply model using the forecasts produced by the major forecasters. SAFE stands for Simple Averaged Forecasters Estimate. Essentially, I average the probability of a candidate winning a state across the six major forecasters, then multiply that averaged probability with that state's electoral votes. Summing the estimated electoral votes across states for each candidate gives us a very simple model of what the election outcome might look like.

## Current Prediction

As of November 5th, SAFE is estimating that Hillary Clinton will win 314 electoral votes to Donald Trump's 224.

Clinton's lead has declined over the past week. On 11/1, SAFE estimated she would win 328 electoral votes. While FiveThirtyEight has moved the most aggresively towards Trump, Clinton's lead has softened in most of the major forecasts.

Clinton has seen her probability of winning North Carolina and New Hampshire decline significantly over the past few days.

Clinton's chances in North Carolina have declined to 70.4% across the major forecasters, down 12 percentage points since November 1st.
